# mdcv 

This is a repository to hold the updates that I make to the `print` version of my CV. Originally the idea was to do this in markdown (hence the name `mdcv` --> "Markdown CV"). 

This version uses 100%, grass-fed, LaTeX <3.

I pull these files into a session on Overleaf.com to update and compile the PDF. 

It's a stupid-simple process but, honestly, that's how I want it to work (when it comes to my CV).
